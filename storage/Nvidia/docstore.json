Business\nOur Company\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. NVIDIA is now a full-stack computing infrastructurecompany with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.\nOur full-stack includes the foundational CUDA programming model that runs on all NVIDIA GPUs, as well as hundreds of domain-specific software libraries,\nsoftware development kits, or SDKs, and Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs. This deep and broad software stack accelerates the performance andeases the deployment of NVIDIA accelerated computing for computationally intensive workloads such as artificial intelligence, or AI, model training andinference, data analytics, scientific computing, and 3D graphics, with vertical-specific optimizations to address industries ranging from healthcare and telecom to\nautomotive and manufacturing.\nOur data-center-scale offerings are comprised of compute and networking solutions that can scale to tens of thousands of GPU-accelerated servers\ninterconnected to function as a single giant computer; this type of data center architecture and scale is needed for the development and deployment of modernAI applications.\nThe GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films. Today, it also simulates human intelligence,\nenabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing capabilities, supported by thousands of computing cores, are essential for deeplearning algorithms. This form of AI, in which software writes itself by learning from large amounts of data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots and self-\ndriving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered AI solutions are being developed by thousands of enterprises to deliver services andproducts that would have been immensely difficult or even impossible with traditional coding. Examples include generative AI, which can create new contentsuch as text, code, images, audio, video, and molecule structures, and recommendation systems, which can recommend highly relevant content such as\nproducts, services, media or ads using deep neural networks trained on vast datasets that capture the user preferences.\nNVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware, systems, software, algorithms, libraries, and services to create unique value for the markets we\nserve. While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs andnetworking and software stacks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the sameunderlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third-party developers and partners. The large and growing number\nof developers and installed base across our platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases the value of our platform to our customers.\nInnovation is at our core. We have invested over $45.3 billion in research and development since our inception, yielding inventions that are essential to modern\ncomputing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. With our introduction of the CUDAprogramming model in 2006, we opened the parallel processing capabilities of our GPU to a broad range of compute-intensive applications, paving the way forthe emergence of modern AI. In 2012, the AlexNet neural network, trained on NVIDIA GPUs, won the ImageNet computer image recognition competition,\nmarking the \u201cBig Bang\u201d moment of AI. We introduced our first Tensor Core GPU in 2017, built from the ground-up for the new era of AI, and our first autonomousdriving system-on-chips, or SoC, in 2018. Our acquisition of Mellanox in 2020 expanded our innovation canvas to include networking and led to the introductionof a new processor class \u2013 the data processing unit, or DPU. Over the past 5 years, we have built full software stacks that run on top of our GPUs and CUDA to\nbring AI to the world\u2019s largest industries, including NVIDIA DRIVE stack for autonomous driving, Clara for healthcare, and Omniverse for industrial digitalization;and introduced the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software \u2013 essentially an operating system for enterprise AI applications. In 2023, we introduced our first data center\nCPU, Grace, built for giant-scale AI and high-performance computing. With a strong engineering culture, we drive fast, yet harmonized, product and technologyinnovations in all dimensions of computing including silicon, systems, networking, software and algorithms. More than half of our engineers work on software.\nThe world\u2019s leading cloud service providers, or CSPs, and consumer internet companies use our data center-scale accelerated computing platforms to enable,\naccelerate or enrich the services they deliver to billions of end users, including AI solutions and assistants, search, recommendations, social networking, onlineshopping, live video, and translation.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5135, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4bb34ac-627c-47d7-b1d1-228932cd63ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4bb34ac-627c-47d7-b1d1-228932cd63ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5a86e090-0f35-4904-bdad-ff9b8a25e24b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-08"}, "hash": "84b152a517daf53f05684d146ddfb442994c4700fe6ec127e21ed708b02b4f7e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3fb603f9-8592-411e-8b89-1ad91b55e1d5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-08"}, "hash": "3877dac0caf3182e26936e3f1968b3b82843e9a9735525414b508f188029b9e4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In 2023, we introduced our first data center\nCPU, Grace, built for giant-scale AI and high-performance computing.

In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply\nor capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended.

We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and\nmay continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scale their capabilities to meet our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity,which may require additional deposits.

Entering fiscal year 2025, we are gathering customer demand indications acrossseveral product transitions. We have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply andcapacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. These increased purchase\nvolumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. We may continue toenter into new supplier and capacity arrangements. Our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal\nyear 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certain components. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains verystrong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments ifour inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\nOur customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have experienced in the past. Product transitions arecomplex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to shipand support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center,\nProfessional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AIopportunities.

If we are unable to\nexecute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted. The increasing frequency and complexity ofnewly introduced products may result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty or othercosts or result in product delays. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has\nimpacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions andhave previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact oursupply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\nMany end customers often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, andother channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by our multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in\nresponse to changing market conditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our abilityto properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties.\nIf we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production\nand we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase supply to meet customer demand, we maynot be able to do so in a timely manner, or our contract manufacturers may experience supply constraints. If we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand\nor otherwise fail to fulfill our customers\u2019 orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and marketshare and our reputation could be harmed. Additionally, since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availabilityissues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact.\nIf we overestimate our customers\u2019 future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we maynot be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including\ndue to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we mayneed to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers\u2019 increase in prices, and we may need tocontinue to do so for other products in the future. We have also written down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments and may\nhave to do so in the future. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms well in advance of ourhistorical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and maycontinue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total\nsupply. All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\nWe build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications, such as NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, NVIDIA AI Foundations,\nOmniverse platform, LLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatilityin our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services.

For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us regarding our business and competition in thegraphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also received requests for information\nfrom regulators in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and China regarding our sales of GPUs, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and ourinvestments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, and we expect to receive additional requests for information in\nthe future. Governments and regulators are considering imposing restrictions on the hardware, software, and systems used to develop frontier foundationmodels and generative AI. If implemented, such restrictions could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of newsystems using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to laws\nor regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties ortariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing\nof our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact ourbusiness and results of operations.\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or\nexport regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas orother trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export\nlicense with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time),and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business.

Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose\nburdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors,as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China topursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.\nGiven the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any timeand further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In theevent of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing\nrequirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USGhas already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license\nconditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, or by requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that would disable or impair GPUs ifcertain system or use conditions are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands suchcontrols to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such\nproducts to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of ourproducts, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell datacenter GPUs may also negatively impact\ndemand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a widerrange of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are\noutside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside China and otherimpacted regions to \u201cdesign-out\u201d certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to\nserve markets worldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request thatour customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results. As a result,excessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also in other markets, such as Europe,\nLatin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by thetime a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase\ninvestment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls.\nAdditionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gamingrevenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government may impose restrictions\non the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers.

The theft, loss or misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners couldresult in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legalclaims.\nIn the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including for data breach notification, personaldata privacy and consumer protection. In the past few years, numerous U.S. states have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on\ncovered businesses, including providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. Asapplicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such astargeted advertising, profiling and automated decision-making. The exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to provide our products and\nservices. Certain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacyimpact assessments. These state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended bythe California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, or collectively the CCPA, gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing\nof their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. The CCPA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per intentionalviolation and the law created a private right of action for certain data breaches. Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal\nand local levels. Additionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related to the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in productsand services. If we become subject to additional data privacy laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase.\nWorldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection. The European Union adopted\nthe General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom similarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data ofpersons within the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose\ndata is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to comply, we could be subject to penalties of up to \u20ac20 million or4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and classes of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing oftheir personal data. Furthermore, the EU AI Act could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to\nchange our business practices.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to the United States or other countries. Certain\njurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws. For example, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer ofpersonal data to countries outside of the EEA. The European Commission released a set of \u201cStandard Contractual Clauses\u201d designed for entities to validlytransfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection, including the\nUnited States. Additionally, the U.K.\u2019s International Data Transfer Agreement / Addendum, as well as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the U.K.extension thereto (which allows for transfers to relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify compliance and participate in the Framework) are mechanisms\nthat may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and U.K. to the United States. However, these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there isno assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or areconsidering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any of which would increase the cost and complexity of\ndoing business and could result in fines from regulators. For example, China\u2019s law imposes various requirements relating to data processing and datalocalization.

These obligations may affect our product design and necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems and\npractices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, we or third parties we rely upon may fail to comply withsuch obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could face significantconsequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing\npersonal data, and orders to destroy or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financialcondition.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, higher than expectedtax rates and other tax-related factors.\nWe are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in\ndetermining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Althoughwe believe our tax estimates are reasonable, any adverse outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes\nimposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, net income, and cash flows.\nFurther, changes in tax laws or their interpretation by tax authorities in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions could increase our future tax liability or cause otheradverse tax impacts, which may materially impact our results of operations, or the way we conduct our business. Most of our income is taxable in the United\nStates, with a significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or FDII. If U.S. tax rates increase or the FDII deductionis reduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations, net income and cash flows would be adversely affected. In addition, changes in the tax laws of\nforeign jurisdictions could arise as a result of global implementation of the Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and Pillar Two Model Rulesannounced by The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD. These and other changes in the foreign tax laws, as adopted bycountries, may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or statutory rates, the mix of earnings in countrieswith differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives, credits and deductions, the expiration of statutes of limitations, changes in accounting principles,adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, the estimates of our deferred tax assets and\nliabilities and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for businesscombinations, as well as changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure. Furthermore, the tax effects of accounting for\nstock-based compensation and volatility in our stock price may significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period in which they occur. A decline in our stockprice may result in reduced future tax benefits from stock-based compensation, increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.\nWe currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder,consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business. For example, we are defending a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders\nasserting claims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrencymining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018.

Cybersecurity\nRisk management and strategy\nWe have in place certain infrastructure, systems, policies, and procedures that are designed to proactively and reactively address circumstances that arise when\nunexpected events such as a cybersecurity incident occur. These include processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecuritythreats. Our information security management program generally follows processes outlined in frameworks such as the ISO 27001 international standard forInformation Security and we evaluate and evolve our security measures as appropriate. We consult with external parties, such as cybersecurity firms and risk\nmanagement and governance experts, on risk management and strategy.\nIdentifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes, and we have in place\ncybersecurity and data privacy training and policies designed to (a) respond to new requirements in global privacy laws and (b) prevent, detect, respond to,mitigate and recover from identified and significant cybersecurity threats.\nWe also have a vendor risk assessment process consisting of the distribution and review of supplier questionnaires designed to help us evaluate cybersecurity\nrisks that we may encounter when working with third parties that have access to confidential and other sensitive company information. We take steps designedto ensure that such vendors have implemented data privacy and security controls that help mitigate the cybersecurity risks associated with these vendors. We\nroutinely assess our high-risk suppliers\u2019 conformance to industry standards (e.g., ISO 27001, ISO 28001, and C-TPAT), and we evaluate them for additionalinformation, product, and physical security requirements.\nRefer to \u201cItem 1A.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d, our\nConsolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report onForm 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock. \nOverview\nOur Company and Our Businesses\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have\nexpanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for acceleratedcomputing, AI solutions, scientific computing, data science, AV, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications.\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics.\" Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV,Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nDemand and Supply, Product Transitions, and New Products and Business Models\nDemand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year 2024. Entering fiscal year 2025, we are gathering customer demand indications acrossseveral product transitions. We have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply andcapacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. These increased purchase\nvolumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. Our purchasecommitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal year 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certaincomponents. We may continue to enter into new supplier and capacity arrangements. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains\nvery strong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications. We may incur inventory provisions orimpairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\nWe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have entered into long-term supply and capacity commitments,we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. Theserisks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain,\ncreating additional supply chain complexity.\nProduct transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and\nsupport new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center,Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AIopportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to manufacturing\nlead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architecturesahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. The increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products\ncould result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty or other costs or result in product delays. Deployment of newproducts to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing ofcustomer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures\nat the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\nWe build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications such as our NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, Omniverse platform,\nLLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue orsupply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies, such asgenerative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center, the long-term trajectory is unknown.\n34", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5289, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27ed3b48-e9bc-4e04-9e44-c8f3b7690867": {"__data__": {"id_": "27ed3b48-e9bc-4e04-9e44-c8f3b7690867", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ab0cc074-10a8-4220-bfd4-ee913973f0d0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-08"}, "hash": "154da916a1ac023d2e257a5b7fc114a68e63245a2940b1480c1ce385e48f3dd0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ddfe3ea1-22e6-49dc-b283-339f081f2090", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "17780cd26117b68ca440cc3cb61ab1b12ae309dbb06bdef4b2975e87896d4962", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Table of Contents\nGlobal Trade\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong\nKong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other\nregions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports toChina and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our\nproducts exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply tothe export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5,\nincluding China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100,H800, and L40S products. Our sales to China decreased as a percentage of total Data Center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal year 2024.\nWe have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. We are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions,including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. We have started to ship alternatives to the China marketin small volumes. China represented a mid-single digit percentage of our Data Center revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to USG licensingrequirements and we expect China to be in a similar range in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by thelicensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license, or that the USG will act on thelicense application in a timely manner or at all.\nOur competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed in the long term, if there are further changes inthe USG\u2019s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the\nexport control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting ourbusiness and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement\nproducts not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including theMiddle East.\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, new and existing export\ncontrols or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business.

Thepreparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of\nrevenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimationuncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of inventories,\nrevenue recognition, and income taxes. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies.\nInventories\nWe charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, andfor excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels\nand future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which requires management judgment.\nSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes in business and economic conditions,changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and\ncustomer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand, failure to estimate customerdemand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times, government regulations and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for\ncompetitive products, including competitive actions. Cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.\nThe net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% in fiscal year 2024and 7.5% in fiscal year 2023. Our inventory and capacity purchase commitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand. We account for our third-\nparty manufacturers' lead times and constraints. Our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve monthsfor some products. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums andprovide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors,\nnew product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates andjudgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based,\nin part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where weoperate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our\nestimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded taxliability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statementsaccordingly.\nAs of the end of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, related to capital loss carryforwards, andcertain state and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable\nincome, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assetsas income tax benefits during the period.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits\nof the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\n37", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5087, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60aac813-9cb3-49dd-a27e-3d7df3c2caca": {"__data__": {"id_": "60aac813-9cb3-49dd-a27e-3d7df3c2caca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "50133016-742f-45c0-a92b-43df405dae21", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-08"}, "hash": "aea7a0737f557ae00626fe3641eb0e0ce6177f1c634ab3dd18476421e80ea99b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Table of Contents\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue Allowances\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time\nrevenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates,we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stockingdistributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow\nreturns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances.\nWe account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs based on\nthe amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specificproducts and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program accrualsinclude a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors.\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nRevenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting\nperiod, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project.Estimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customercontract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require asignificant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct\nand are not combined for revenue recognition purposes.\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling\nprice basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparablecircumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, wedetermine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the\nestimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and testequipment from five years to seven years. The estimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost ofrevenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or\n$0.05 per both basic and diluted share.\nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is presented below.

Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 56% and 69% of total revenue for fiscal years 2024\nand 2023, respectively.\nOur direct and indirect customers include public cloud, consumer internet companies, enterprises, startups, public sector entities, OEMs, ODMs, systemintegrators, AIB, and distributors.\nSales to one customer, Customer A, represented 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, which was attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.\nOne indirect customer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Customer A, is estimated to have\nrepresented approximately 19% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.\nOur estimated Compute & Networking demand is expected to remain concentrated.\nThere were no customers with 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer\nfabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with suchpurchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includesacquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel\nassociated with manufacturing operations.\nOur overall gross margin increased to 72.7% in fiscal year 2024 from 56.9% in fiscal year 2023. The year over year increase was primarily due to strong Data\nCenter revenue growth of 217% and lower net inventory provisions as a percentage of revenue.\nProvisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $2.2 billion for both fiscal years 2024 and 2023. Sales of previously reservedinventory or settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $540 million and $137 million for fiscal years 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.

We recognized a non-cash net benefit of $145 million, related to this IRS audit resolution, for effectively settled positions. This benefit consists of areduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $236 million and related accrued interest of $17 million, net of federal benefit, partially offset by additional cash taxpayments and reductions in tax attribute carryforwards of $108 million.\nThe effective tax rate increased due to a decreased impact of tax benefits from the FDII deduction, stock-based compensation, and the U.S. federal research taxcredit, relative to the increase in income before income tax. The increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by a benefit due to the IRS audit resolution.\nOur effective tax rates for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to tax benefits from the FDII deduction,stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal research tax credit. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 was additionally benefited by the IRS auditresolution.\nThe OECD has announced an Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting including Pillar Two Model Rules for a new 15% global minimum taxapplicable to large multinational corporations. Certain jurisdictions, including European Union member states and the United Kingdom, have enacted Pillar Two\nlegislation that will start to become effective for our fiscal year 2025. The OECD, and its member countries, continue to release new guidance and legislation onPillar Two and we continue to evaluate the impact on our financial position of the global implementation of these rules. Based on enacted laws, Pillar Two is notexpected to materially impact our effective tax rate or cash flows in the next fiscal year. New legislation or guidance could change our current assessment.\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n41", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3457, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1a1da0ca-396d-4aae-a15b-b1b783df5fd9": {"__data__": {"id_": "1a1da0ca-396d-4aae-a15b-b1b783df5fd9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e26949d0-d9ab-4682-b93e-7b6539f4407c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-08"}, "hash": "2200082f2d43f6c8adac3f700fa2c8f607717e969fbb7e5b3ce2435161e2932f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Table of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n Jan 28, 2024 Jan 29, 2023\n (In millions)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 7,280 $ 3,389 \nMarketable securities 18,704 9,907 \nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 25,984 $ 13,296 \n Year Ended\nJan 28, 2024 Jan 29, 2023\n (In millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 28,090 $ 5,641 \nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (10,566)$ 7,375 \nNet cash used in financing activities $ (13,633)$ (11,617)\nOur investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certainmaturity limits on our portfolio.\nCash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, due to growth in revenue.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2024,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the TreadwayCommission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January\n28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2024 inconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issuedby the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and forits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial\nReporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internalcontrol over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (UnitedStates) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internalcontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal controlover financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, andtesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financialreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparationof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n48", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5534, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e9bb7cee-66fc-4586-a6d5-6f5be2d9638d": {"__data__": {"id_": "e9bb7cee-66fc-4586-a6d5-6f5be2d9638d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ec8d8c16-cdf1-4fe0-9169-dba9a10a78a0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-08"}, "hash": "2b8ad8639d335a9c8f75729a6baf96867e3c35bdcf4b00769fe42fee5b0428f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Table of Contents\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated orrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and\n(ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion onthe consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the\ncritical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments\nAs described in Notes 1, 10 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down inventory\nfor excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of the Company\u2019s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities ofproducts, based on the Company\u2019s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market\nconditions. As of January 28, 2024, the Company\u2019s consolidated inventories balance was $5.3 billion and the Company\u2019s consolidated outstanding inventorypurchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations balance was $16.1 billion, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess or\nobsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developingprovisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to future demand and\nmarket conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management\u2019s assumptionsrelated to future demand and market conditions.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excessproduct purchase commitments, including controls over management\u2019s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also\nincluded, among others, testing management\u2019s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchasecommitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management\u2019s approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; andevaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.

All intercompany balances andtransactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenueand expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, includingthose related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories and product purchase commitments, income\ntaxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, property, plant, and equipment, andother contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.\nIn February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the\nestimated useful life of most of our server, storage, and network equipment from three to four or five years, and our assembly and test equipment from five toseven years. The effect of this change for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating\nexpenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic anddiluted share.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services. Wedetermine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in\nthe contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue isallocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performanceobligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in\nexchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Supportand extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances forreturns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the timerevenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates,\nwe may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to accurately reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketingdevelopment funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our\npartners\u2019 activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for such programs forpotential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\n55", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4690, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d46ff006-e729-4def-98d8-150b792b8671": {"__data__": {"id_": "d46ff006-e729-4def-98d8-150b792b8671", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4d578522-772f-4ca5-a025-1637b6ef4852", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-08"}, "hash": "bae339370a58b9df1615ec8ab30e9ae6f5584799286839e7f6a32ca25ecc0c4b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Table of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and SubsidiariesNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we recognize the\nrevenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development servicesare performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete eachproject. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.\nSoftware Licensing\nOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either\nperpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses arefrequently sold along with the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from softwarelicenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or\nas services are performed.\nCloud Services\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of the software or hardware, are provided\non a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over thecontract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs. Cloud services are typically sold on a standalone basis, but\ncertain offerings may be sold with hardware and/or software and related support.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance\nobligation. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreementsindicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract.\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone sellingprice basis. The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstancesand to similar customers. When determining standalone selling price, we maximize the use of observable inputs.\nIf a contract contains a single performance obligation, no allocation is required.\nProduct Warranties\nWe offer a limited warranty to end-users ranging from one to three years for products to repair or replace products for manufacturing defects or hardwarecomponent failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limitedcircumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a\nloss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units,\nor RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date ofgrant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs\nand market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUsis recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP,using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is\nexpensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually andrevise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.\nLitigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\nWe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent andother intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third\nparties, and other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions\n56", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5260, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e8dde30-dba0-4c82-b4e2-9ca44d9b188d": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e8dde30-dba0-4c82-b4e2-9ca44d9b188d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5de5b57a-df52-46df-b2e4-1d160bbd88eb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-08"}, "hash": "62ce0d6ba076721dec92e98e8cf42d4ef3261bb0ba99504b6dcad2eae5433aca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a11acafa-cea8-4c10-84e0-2997c1d398f9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ee9070bcb93415202e5df03ff5b5c67f2ff5f923e99b37781c4d8aa5f1013a51", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Table of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)\nor other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments or judgments. If information becomes\navailable that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate theloss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be\nmaterially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.\nForeign Currency Remeasurement\nWe use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars\nat end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates.Revenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet\namounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our ConsolidatedStatements of Income and to date have not been significant.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by taxjurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary\ndifferences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on availableevidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of\ncomplex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome,changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S., or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we\nrecognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may bedue. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required torecognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\nAs of January 28, 2024, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6 billion related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets thatmanagement determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extentrealization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical meritsof the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nNet Income Per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share iscomputed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Any\nanti-dilutive effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to becash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currentlyclassify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These available-for-saledebt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component\nof shareholders\u2019 equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest.

Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value withthe related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders\u2019 equity, net of tax. Fair value\nof the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measuredat fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Forderivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting\nlosses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of thegains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when\nthe hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized inearnings.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accountsreceivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, andincludes certain limits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers\u2019 financial condition and maintain an allowance for\npotential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overallestimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consistprimarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead\nassociated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. Wecharge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for\nexcess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future productpurchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates anew cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We record a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in\nexcess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line methodbased on the estimated useful lives of the assets of three to seven years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost andaccumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years.\nDepreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under finance leasesare amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in operating leaseassets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our\nright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowingrate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the leaseterm.\nWe combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.\n58", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5576, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75442d45-aab7-48de-b73b-b43ee20809a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "75442d45-aab7-48de-b73b-b43ee20809a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "34fe4ab5-03d2-420a-8e91-b9de80986e52", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-08"}, "hash": "8a03ed0f131ac3cf819816986ca94f599e98de9181b8da5a2a9ca248016571c2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "35402dc0-eae1-4a02-b804-07f940e82575", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "edb4e2341d527e69c28512d460f842e088fe0572c3ac2f1115e4facf854985fe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Table of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist.

The income and marketvaluation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and\ncomparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economicfactors and the future profitability of our business. \nIntangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired undertechnology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a\nmethod that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliablydetermined, using a straight-line amortization method.\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held andused is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by\nthe asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for theamount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined basedon the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately\npresented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would nolonger be depreciated.\nBusiness Combination\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, based ontheir estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded\nas goodwill. Management\u2019s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherentlyuncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing ofprojected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and,\ntherefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we mayrecord adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the measurement period's conclusion or final\ndetermination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our ConsolidatedStatements of Income.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.\nInvestments in Non-Affiliated Entities\nOur investment in non-affiliates consists of marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and non-marketable equity securities, which are investments\nin privately held companies. Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair values with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense),net. Non-marketable equity securities include investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value. The investments that do not have readilydeterminable fair value are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly\ntransactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer, or the measurement alternative. Fair value is based upon observable inputs in an inactivemarket and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. All gains and losses on these investments,\nrealized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5302, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35402dc0-eae1-4a02-b804-07f940e82575": {"__data__": {"id_": "35402dc0-eae1-4a02-b804-07f940e82575", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "34fe4ab5-03d2-420a-8e91-b9de80986e52", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-08"}, "hash": "8a03ed0f131ac3cf819816986ca94f599e98de9181b8da5a2a9ca248016571c2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "75442d45-aab7-48de-b73b-b43ee20809a1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-08"}, "hash": "32385ba819b1b97ea6fc5776c80804f13d65943fea771300f523954d3250bc6a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair values with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense),net.

The amended\ncomplaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act,and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demandbetween May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the\nExchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, includingattorneys\u2019 fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA\u2019s motion to\ndismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal fromjudgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604.

It shall be binding and enforceable against\nall Covered Officers and, to the extent required by the Compensation Recovery Rules, their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal\nrepresentatives.\nThis Policy amends and restates the Prior Policy with respect to all Incentive Compensation that is Received by a Covered Officer on and after the Effective\nDate. The Prior Policy shall continue to apply to Incentive Compensation Received by a Covered Officer prior to the Effective Date.\nPolicy Statement | Responsibilities\nIn the event of an Accounting Restatement, regardless of whether or when any restated financial statements are filed, the Company must reasonably promptly\nrecover the full amount of the Recoverable Incentive Compensation, regardless of whether the Covered Officer engaged in any misconduct and regardless of\nfault.\nFor any compensation plans or programs involving Incentive Compensation, the amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation shall include the amount\ncontributed to any notional account based on Recoverable Incentive Compensation and any earnings to date on that notional amount. For any Incentive\nCompensation that is based on stock price or TSR, where the amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation\ndirectly from the information in an Accounting Restatement, the amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation shall be based on a reasonable estimate of the\neffect of the Accounting Restatement on the applicable stock price or TSR. The Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable\nestimate and provide it to Nasdaq in accordance with Rule 5608.\nThe Company would not be required to recover Recoverable Incentive Compensation if (I) (A) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this\nPolicy would exceed the amount of the Recoverable Incentive Compensation, or (B) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan,\nunder which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of Code Sections 401(a)(13) or 411(a) and regulations\nthereunder and (II) the Committee (or in the absence of a Committee, a majority of the independent members of the Board) determines that recovery would be\nimpracticable. However, before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation based on expense of\nenforcement under (I)(A) of this paragraph, the Company shall make a reasonable attempt to recover such Recoverable Incentive Compensation, document its\nreasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that documentation to Nasdaq in accordance with Rule 5608.\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine the timing and method for recovering Recoverable Incentive\nCompensation, provided that the recovery is undertaken reasonably promptly. The Committee may, but is not limited to, seek recovery from a Covered Officer\nfrom any or a combination of the following sources, irrespective of whether the applicable source of compensation was approved, awarded, granted, payable or\npaid to the Covered Officer prior to, on, or after the Effective Date: (i) direct repayment of Recoverable Incentive Compensation previously paid to the Covered\nOfficer; (ii) cancelling or directing the return of prior cash or equity-based awards (whether vested or unvested and whether paid or unpaid); (iii) cancelling or\noffsetting against any planned future cash or equity-based awards; (iv) forfeiture of any deferred compensation, subject to compliance with Code Section 409A;\nand (v) any other method authorized by applicable\nNVIDIA Corporation    Application: GlobalDocument Name: Compensation Recovery Policy - External            Page 1 of 5", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 9, "end_char_idx": 4653, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "628bb8d0-724c-4406-8804-ff707b10cfe3": {"__data__": {"id_": "628bb8d0-724c-4406-8804-ff707b10cfe3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5909976e-39e7-4972-99a9-e41e759a01f5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Nvidia_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-08"}, "hash": "9e097992861798e64c87cbe3ed69e4545d43982794917ca6c7417ebdf580fe4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "COMPENSATION RECOVERY POLICY\nlaw or contract.
