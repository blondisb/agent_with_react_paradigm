Europe \nincludes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong \nand Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company\u2019s other reportable \nsegments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is \nmanaged separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market \ndynamics of each geographic region.\nMarkets and Distribution\nThe Company\u2019s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government \nmarkets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers \nthrough its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution \nchannels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers.

Many of \nthe Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating \nthe Company\u2019s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 2", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3664, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5756682-9e21-4c00-a014-5c8949106ebf": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5756682-9e21-4c00-a014-5c8949106ebf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "Apple_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Apple_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 963934, "creation_date": "2025-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d641386b-084b-4f9f-9f2d-13bbdc5acb8c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "Apple_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Apple_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 963934, "creation_date": "2025-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-10"}, "hash": "ec9e2f0064aa68f44057f47335079a31ccac99eb399e9680028f48c15fe3bd15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative \nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for \nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal \ncompetitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative \nprice and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and \naccessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables \nand accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have \nsignificant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings \nwith large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products \nand a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut \nprices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products \nat little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company\u2019s services compete with business models that provide content to users for \nfree and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition \nas competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated \nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain \ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with \nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many \ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide \nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by \nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new \ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have \nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to \nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the \nCompany will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\u2019s \nability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, \nservices and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing \nproducts and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d), licensing of \nintellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its h ardware, \naccessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of \nintellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such \nintellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such \nownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, \ndevelopment, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the \nCompany has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single \nintellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company\u2019s products and services. The Company believes the \nduration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include \nintellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various \naspects of the Company\u2019s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such \nlicenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future \non reasonable terms or at all.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 3", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5772, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0578bbc-ca18-40ab-9deb-f600c1d7e99f": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0578bbc-ca18-40ab-9deb-f600c1d7e99f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Apple_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Apple_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 963934, "creation_date": "2025-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2f57b9eb-3de7-485b-a3c7-4e581371880a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Apple_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Apple_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 963934, "creation_date": "2025-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-10"}, "hash": "f2957cd83aed16642b32dbea9f47da8a26db1f795bebe44e945b422236cd39e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Business Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in \npart to seasonal holiday demand.

The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company\u2019s net sales to its indirect \ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an \nolder product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and \ndistributors anticipate a product introduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believ es that its people play an important role in its success, and strives to attract, develop and retain the best \ntalent.

The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and \nsupport equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.\nEngagement\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an \nopen, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to \ncome to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee \nsentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\nHealth and Safety\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace \nrisks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security \nand crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard \nenvironments.

When any one or more of these risks materialize \nfrom time to time, the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially \nand adversely affected.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition, \npast financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not \nuse historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking \nstatements.\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition \nand Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial \nStatements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and \nadverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial \ncondition.\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales. \nIn addition, the Company\u2019s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\u2019s supplier facilities, including \nmanufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company\u2019s operations and performance depend \nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher \ninterest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely \naffect demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially \nadversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset \nvalues, and other economic factors.\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global \nor regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics \nproviders, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial \ninstability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\u2019s trade receivables; the \nfailure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to issue new debt; reduced \nliquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company\u2019s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially \nadversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 5", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4551, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b06bc26d-61cc-458f-bbda-1d7886bfed48": {"__data__": {"id_": "b06bc26d-61cc-458f-bbda-1d7886bfed48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Apple_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Apple_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 963934, "creation_date": "2025-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cae5f4ac-7f71-4f33-b550-76a94e340046", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Apple_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Apple_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 963934, "creation_date": "2025-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-10"}, "hash": "21bd59ef7b22b7899307cf7255513b855907b25ad825f686530bc0efcb8fd05c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The Company\u2019s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical \ntensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business \ninterruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health \nissues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the Company and its \ncustomers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other \nchannel partners.\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales, \nand the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s \nmanufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South \nKorea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, \ntechnology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly \nsignificant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its \nrevenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost of the Company\u2019s products \nand the components and raw materials that go into them, and can require the Company to take various actions, including \nchanging suppliers, restructuring business relationships and operations, and ceasing to offer and distribute affected products, \nservices and third-party applications to its customers. Changing the Company\u2019s business and supply chain in accordance with \nnew or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\u2019s \noperations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company \nmay not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, \nincluding the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions affecting the Company\u2019s business. If disputes \nand conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive \nand could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nMany of the Company\u2019s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract \nmanufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is resulting in \ncertain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In addition, the \nCompany\u2019s and its suppliers\u2019 operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear \npower plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity \nattacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company\u2019s control. For example, global supply chains \ncan be highly concentrated and geopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions.\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create \ndelays and inefficiencies in the Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s \nservice offerings, increase the Company\u2019s costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While \nthe Company\u2019s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur \nand could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company\u2019s business, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. \nMajor public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the \nfuture materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; \nthe imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight \nservices and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\u2019s operations, supply chain and sales \nand distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays \nin production ramps of new products and development of new services.\nFollowing any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant \nexpenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the \nsupply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any \nnegative consequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such \ninsurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 6", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5551, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f5c7cb1-8a58-4a91-ba83-4deb268152bb": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f5c7cb1-8a58-4a91-ba83-4deb268152bb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "Apple_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Apple_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 963934, "creation_date": "2025-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "eeec35d8-98d2-4315-984a-0615180e1878", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "Apple_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Apple_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 963934, "creation_date": "2025-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-10"}, "hash": "d0b1c7ad636ff407da94b6a55ca0f0ce2cf77aacbf2618de9fa1ebd03a6a3006", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Global markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological \nchange, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price \ncompetition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short \nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid \nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative \nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for \nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the \nCompany must make significant investments in R&D.

The Company faces \nsubstantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other \nresources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the \nCompany\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. \nCompetition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain \ncompetitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of \nthe markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications \nwithin their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also \nexpects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their \nofferings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\nThe Company\u2019s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and \nexperience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models \nthat provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content \nand applications.\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company\u2019s ability to \ncontinually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the \nCompany will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\nBusiness Risks\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions \nand transitions of products and services.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company \nmust continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively \nstimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new \nand upgraded products and services.

While \nthe Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from \ntime to time and can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many \ncomponents, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u2019s \nhardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s cost or supply of \ncomponents or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be \ndisrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial \ndisputes, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, trade and other international disputes, \ngeopolitical tensions, or conflict.\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, \nand has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements \nhelp ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial \nproblems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be disrupted or terminated, and the recoverability of \nmanufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\nChanges or additions to the Company\u2019s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and \nuncertainties, including exposure to additional regulatory and operational risks.\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on \ncommercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant \nsupply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to \nindustry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s \nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past \nexperienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities \nof components and products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the \nCompany has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able \nto extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. In addition, component suppliers may suffer from poor financial \nconditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the \nCompany\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.  Therefore, the \nCompany remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its \nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product \nuses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing \ncapacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any \nnumber of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components \ncustomized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. When the Company\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing product has \nbeen delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the \nCompany\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints \ncould materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5714, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ded067ca-692f-456b-85d6-9f97a6dfe022": {"__data__": {"id_": "ded067ca-692f-456b-85d6-9f97a6dfe022", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "Apple_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Apple_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 963934, "creation_date": "2025-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "031b0be7-4db9-45c0-91d9-a1c2a3b46e25", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "Apple_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Apple_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 963934, "creation_date": "2025-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-10"}, "hash": "7ce59999d1902d0e41ff628bf67b2f46ecfbc641e4e355a6e30d64cf7f9dda7a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3e125f9-21ed-45d6-9024-7ad03db77e24", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "Apple_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Apple_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 963934, "creation_date": "2025-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-10"}, "hash": "c2f8fc0ade33da45994647d1a2cec9fe91808d5cb8d3800b42ac132ca960d535", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source.

Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues \nthat can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist \nin components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company\u2019s \nproducts unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the \nCompany\u2019s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company\u2019s service offerings \ncan have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the \nCompany\u2019s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. The introduction of new and \ncomplex technologies, such as artificial intelligence features, can increase these and other safety risks, including exposing users \nto harmful, inaccurate or other negative content and experiences. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect \nand fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical \nand performance issues affecting the Company\u2019s products and services. Errors, bugs and vulnerabilities can be exploited by \nthird parties, compromising the safety and security of a user\u2019s device. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product \nliability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible \nassets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can \nadversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s \nreputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new \nproduct and service introductions and lost sales.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase \ncommitment cancellation risk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated \ndemand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for \norders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its \nsuppliers\u2019 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be \nrecoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which \nthe carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory \nprepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company \nwill not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence \nin the industries in which the Company competes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. \nManufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for \nperiods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u2019s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price \nchanges, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components \nor products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on \ncommercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires \nlicenses from those third parties.

The DMA provides for significant fines and penalties for  noncompliance, and other jurisdictions may seek to require the \nCompany to make changes to its business. While the changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new \nprivacy and security risks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will remain.\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world, which can \nresult in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially \nadverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.

In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party \ntransactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several \njurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have \nlaws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with \nemerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future \nrequire the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information \nprovided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to \ncomply with these public statements or with federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could \nresult in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, \npenalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the \nCompany is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health \ndata, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach \nnotification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company\u2019s compliance \nwith these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial \ndata is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company\u2019s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, \nthe Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, \nand can also incur significant fees or fines.\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder \ninformation is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur \nsignificant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also \nexperience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow \npayment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, \nresults of operations and financial condition.\nFinancial Risks\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Company\u2019s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, \nthe gross margins on the Company\u2019s products and services vary significantly and can change over time.

There can be no assurance as to the \noutcome of these examinations. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the \nCompany\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s business, results of \noperations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nGeneral Risks\nThe price of the Company\u2019s stock is subject to volatility.\nThe Company\u2019s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, \nthe Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price \nand volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating \nperformance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to \nexceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future \ngrowth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will \ncontinue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are \nsubject to declaration by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201c Board\u201d), and the Company\u2019s share repurchase program does \nnot obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, \nprofitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company\u2019s stock may decline \nsignificantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nThe Company\u2019s management, led by its Head of Corporate Information Security, has overall responsibility for identifying, \nassessing and managing any material risks from cybersecurity threats. The Company\u2019s Head of Corporate Information Security \nleads a dedicated Information Security team of highly skilled individuals with experience across industries that, among other \nthings, develops and distributes information security policies, standards and procedures; engages in employee cybersecurity \ntraining; implements security controls; assesses security risk and compliance posture; monitors and responds to security events; \nand executes security testing and assessments. The Company\u2019s Head of Corporate Information Security has extensive \nknowledge and skills gained from over 25 years of experience in the cybersecurity industry, including serving in leadership \npositions at other large technology companies and leading the Company\u2019s Information Security team since 2016.\nThe Company\u2019s Information Security team coordinates with teams across the Company to prevent, respond to and manage \nsecurity incidents, and engages third parties, as appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of its security \nprocesses and incident response. A dedicated Supplier Trust team manages information security risks the Company is exposed \nto through its supplier relationships. The Company has processes to log, track, address, and escalate for further assessment and \nreport, as appropriate, cybersecurity incidents across the Company and its suppliers to senior management and the Audit and \nFinance Committee (the \u201cAudit Committee\u201d) of the Board. The Company\u2019s enterprise risk management program  is designed to \nidentify, assess, and monitor the Company\u2019s business risks, including financial, operational, complianc e and reputational risks, \nand reflects management\u2019s assessment of cybersecurity risks.\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board in the oversight and monitoring of cybersecurity matters. The Audit Committee regularly \nreviews and discusses the Company\u2019s cybersecurity risks wit h management, including the Company\u2019s Head of Corporate \nInformation Security , its General Counsel and th e Heads of Compliance and Business Conduct, Business Assuranc e, and \nInternal Audit, and receives updates, as necessary, regarding cybersecurity incidents. The Chair of the Audit Committee \nregularly reports the substance of such reviews and discussions to the Board, as necessary, and recommends to the Board such \nactions as the Audit Committee deems appropriate.\nFor a discussion of the Company\u2019s cybersecurity-related risks, see Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 17", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4942, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2822899-4636-4120-ab01-1c5a57c0a2b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2822899-4636-4120-ab01-1c5a57c0a2b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "Apple_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Apple_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 963934, "creation_date": "2025-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e3a76602-5b3e-4f23-a31b-c73a3382f135", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "Apple_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Apple_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 963934, "creation_date": "2025-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-10"}, "hash": "1a6521ea88a9ed82ffa38b1e3174104bdf6750f280535d6aa251b16f4b6d21c1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "96916ec4-9581-4622-b68f-39fee4318c60", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "369eda9f7591113796701ac8180496b55ba708291dadb3261b62d3607d798580", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Item 2.

Legal Pr oceedings\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the \nCompany under the DMA. The Commission\u2019s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers \nmay communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may \nconclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, \nand a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced its preliminary findings in the Article \n5(4) investigation alleging that the Company\u2019s App Store rules are in breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a \nthird formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company\u2019s new contractual requirements for third-party \napp developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA. If the Commission makes a final determination that there has been \na violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company\u2019s annual worldwide net sales. \nAlthough any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the \nCommission\u2019s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company \nbelieves that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and \nengagement with the Commission.\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil \nantitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or \nattempted monopolization in the markets for \u201cperformance smartphones\u201d and \u201csmartphones\u201d in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. \nThe DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters \nhave been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S.  alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary \ndamages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend \nitself.\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (\u201cEpic\u201d) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the \u201cCalifornia District \nCourt\u201d) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California\u2019s unfair competition law based \nupon the Company\u2019s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company\u2019s App \nStore Review Guidelines violate California\u2019s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from \nprohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than \nApple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, \n2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California \nDistrict Court. A motion by Epic disputing the Company\u2019s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the \nCompany has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with \nthe California District Court to narrow or vacate the injunction. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to \nvigorously defend itself.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the \nordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in \nthe aggregate have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition or operating results.

As of September\u00a0 28, 2024, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.6 billion , with $2.0 billion  \npayable within 12 months.\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company\u2019s products and to perform \nfinal assembly and testing of finished products.

ASU 2023-09 will also require the Company to disaggregate its income taxes paid \ndisclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. The \nCompany will adopt ASU 2023-09 in its fourth quarter of 2026 using a prospective transition method.\nSegment Reporting\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment \nDisclosures (\u201cASU 2023-07\u201d), which will require the Company to disclose segment expenses that are significant and regularly \nprovided to the Company\u2019s chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d). In addition, ASU 2023-07 will require the Company to \ndisclose the title and position of its CODM and how the CODM uses segment profit or loss information in assessing segment \nperformance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-07 in its fourth quarter of 2025 using a \nretrospective transition method.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles \n(\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the Company\u2019s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u2019s \nmanagement to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant \nAccounting Policies \u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the \nsignificant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. \nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under \nthe circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company\u2019s \nuncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and \ninternational tax laws, including the TCJA and the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although \nmanagement believes the Company\u2019s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these \nuncertainties will not be different from that reflected in the Company\u2019s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing \nfacts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies \nto manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio \nand term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and increase \nthe interest expense on the Company\u2019s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative \ninstruments, offset interest rate\u2013sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any \nassociated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September\u00a028, 2024  and \nSeptember\u00a030, 2023 (dollars in millions):\nInterest Rate\nSensitive Instrument\nHypothetical Interest\nRate Increase Potential Impact 2024 2023\nInvestment portfolio 100 basis points, all tenors Decline in fair value $ 2,755 $ 3,089 \nTerm debt 100 basis points, all tenors Increase in annual interest expense $ 139 $ 194 \nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other \nthan the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the \nCompany\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair \nvalues of certain of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use \nderivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company \nmay choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or \nprohibitive cost.\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of \nfluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair \nvalue, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. \nBased on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $538 \nmillion and $669 million as of September\u00a028, 2024 and September\u00a030, 2023, respectively. Changes in the Company\u2019s underlying \nforeign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the \nCompany\u2019s foreign currency derivatives.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 27", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3041, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c79a0098-88dc-4006-a91d-915f5ed04162": {"__data__": {"id_": "c79a0098-88dc-4006-a91d-915f5ed04162", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "Apple_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Apple_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 963934, "creation_date": "2025-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24959c90-59d8-4b06-8844-30a1e7cd5f55", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "Apple_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Apple_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 963934, "creation_date": "2025-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-10"}, "hash": "7769875aa47a92033e42cddda996788d66579552e57fbe46f73a89089c72f6a6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Item 8.

Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the \nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\u2019s \nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\u2019s Services net sales, control transfers over \ntime as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer \nof control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer \nincentive programs based on the Company\u2019s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the \nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\u201cSSPs\u201d). \nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are \nestablished that reflect the Company\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they \nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\u2019s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers \nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation \nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, \nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac \nand iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the \nhardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive \ncertain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud \u00ae, Siri \u00ae and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any \nrelated discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable \nprices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\u2019s estimated SSPs. Revenue \nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which \ngenerally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized \non a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For \nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that \nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized \nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the \nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when \ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, \nretains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party \napplications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the \ncustomer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application\u2013related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services \nnet sales only the commission it retains.\nNet sales disaggregated by

The Company also competes for various components with \nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many \ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide \nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by \nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new \ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have \nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to \nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in \nChina mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\nNote 13 \u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company\u2019s reportable segments consist of the \nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe \nincludes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong \nand Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company\u2019s other reportable \nsegments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is \nmanaged separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market \ndynamics of each geographic region.\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for \ngeographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company\u2019s retail stores located in \nthose geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and \noperating expenses directly attributable to the segment.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on \nthe Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are \nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable \nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the \naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to \nerror or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial \nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included \nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included \nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall \npresentation of the financial statements.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control \nover financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be \nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and \nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the \naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all \nmaterial respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material \nweakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, \nand performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a \nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the \nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally \naccepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that \n(1)\u00a0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions \nof the assets of the company; (2)\u00a0 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit \npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and \nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the \ncompany; and (3)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \ndisposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, \nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate \nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nNovember\u00a01, 2024\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 50", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4199, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34dbdaea-ba8e-4ed0-a9ce-afd80504a888": {"__data__": {"id_": "34dbdaea-ba8e-4ed0-a9ce-afd80504a888", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "Apple_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Apple_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 963934, "creation_date": "2025-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "31d9421a-28c7-417e-bf34-eb51da6e35de", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "Apple_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Apple_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 963934, "creation_date": "2025-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-10"}, "hash": "983e6e376eabf0fad65fa61f7a0bb399cbd2ed5aba2f5e7e6c2acf5c90e4bf5c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, the Company\u2019s principal \nexecutive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures as defined \nin Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September\u00a0 28, 2024 to provide reasonable \nassurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is \n(i)\u00a0 recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and \n(ii)\u00a0 accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019s management, including its principal executive officer and principal \nfinancial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nThe Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of \nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company\u2019s \ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\u00a0\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and \ndispositions of the Company\u2019s assets;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial \nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company\u2019s receipts and expenditures are being made only in \naccordance with authorizations of the Company\u2019s management and directors; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \ndisposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company\u2019s \ninternal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can \nprovide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a \ncontrol system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative \nto their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute \nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of \ncontrols in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in \nbusiness conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting \n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the \nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company\u2019s \nassessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September\u00a028, 2024 \nto provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in \naccordance with GAAP.

These Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award (these \u201c Terms\u201d) \napply to a particular restricted stock unit award (the \u201c Award\u201d) granted by Apple Inc., a California \ncorporation (the \u201c Company\u201d), and are incorporated by reference in the Notice of Grant (the \u201c Grant \nNotice\u201d) corresponding to that particular grant. The recipient of the Award identified in the Grant Notice is \nreferred to as the \u201cParticipant.\u201d The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice is \nreferred to as the \u201c Award Date.\u201d The Award was granted under and is subject to the provisions of the \nApple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan, as amended from time to time (the \u201c Plan\u201d). Capitalized terms are \ndefined in the Plan if not defined herein. The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the \nParticipant in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be \npaid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these Terms are collectively referred to as the \u201c Award \nAgreement\u201d applicable to the Award.\n2. RSUs.  As used herein, the term \u201c RSU\u201d shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement \nwhich is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to be equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes \nof the Plan and this Award Agreement. RSUs shall be used solely as a device for the determination of the \nShares eventually to be issued to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. \nThe RSUs are an unfunded and unsecured right to receive Shares and shall not be treated as property or \nas a trust fund of any kind.\n3. Vesting.  Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become \nnonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice. (Each vesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred \nto herein as a \u201c Vesting Date. \u201d) Unless and until the Company elects to issue fractional Shares in \nsettlement of a vested RSU, any fractional RSUs that vest on a Vesting Date shall be carried forward and \nvest when such combined fractional RSUs result in a full RSU and any fractional RSU that is not carried \nforward as a result of a termination of the Award prior to the next subsequent Vesting Date shall be \nforfeited.\n4.

Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 \nbelow, vesting of the Award requires continued active employment or service through each applicable \nVesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and the rights and \nbenefits under this Award Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the period between the \nAward Date and the first Vesting Date or between subsequent Vesting Dates, even if a substantial \nportion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this \nAward Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of absence (other \nthan a personal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of \nabsence, in each case as approved by the Company, in its sole discretion.

As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary \ncash dividend on its Shares, the Company shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i)\u00a0the \nper share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Shares on such date, multiplied by (ii)\u00a0the total target \nnumber of RSUs (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan) subject to the \nAward that are outstanding on the record date for that dividend (a \u201c Dividend Equivalent Right \u201d).

No crediting of \nDividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to any RSUs which, \nas of the record date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant to Section 7 or terminated \npursuant to Section 8 or Exhibit A.\n6. Restrictions on Transfer .  Except as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Award, \nthe Dividend Equivalent Rights and any interest therein or amount or Shares issued in respect thereof \nshall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of, alienated or encumbered, \neither voluntarily or involuntarily.\n7. Timing and Manner of Settlement of RSUs.  On or as soon as administratively practical \nfollowing the Vesting Date pursuant to Section 3 or Section 8 (and in all events not later than two and \none-half (2 \u00bd) months after such Vesting Date), the Company shall deliver to the Participant a number of \nShares equal to the number of RSUs subject to the Award that vest on the Vesting Date, less Tax-\nRelated Items. The Company\u2019s obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise settle vested RSUs is subject to \nthe condition precedent that the Participant or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any Shares \nwith respect to the vested RSUs deliver to the Company any representations or other documents or \nassurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The Participant shall have no further rights \nwith respect to any RSUs that are settled or that are forfeited pursuant to Section 8.\n8. Effect of Termination of Service .  Except as expressly provided in Section 4 or this \nSection 8, the Participant\u2019s RSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall terminate to \nthe extent such RSUs have not become vested prior to the date of the Participant\u2019s Termination of \nService, meaning the first date the Participant is no longer employed by or providing services to the \nCompany or one of its Subsidiaries (the \u201c Severance Date\u201d), regardless of the reason for the Participant\u2019s \nTermination of Service, whether with or without cause, voluntarily or involuntarily or whether the \nParticipant was employed or provided services for a portion of the vesting period prior to a Vesting Date \nand the Participant will have no right to the terminated RSUs, any underlying Shares or any cash \nequivalent.

The recipient of the Award identified in the Grant Notice is \nreferred to as the \u201c Participant.\u201d  The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice \nis referred to as the \u201c Award Date.\u201d The Award was granted under and is subject to the provisions of the \nApple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan, as amended from time to time (the \u201c Plan\u201d).  Capitalized terms are \ndefined in the Plan if not defined herein.  The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the \nParticipant in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be \npaid to the Participant.  The Grant Notice and these Terms are collectively referred to as the \u201c Award \nAgreement\u201d applicable to the Award.\n2. RSUs.  As used herein, the term \u201c RSU\u201d shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement \nwhich is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to be equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes \nof the Plan and this Award Agreement.  RSUs shall be used solely as a device for the determination of \nthe Shares eventually to be issued to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award \nAgreement.  The RSUs are an unfunded and unsecured right to receive Shares and shall not be treated \nas property or as a trust fund of any kind.\n3. Vesting.  Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become \nnonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice.  (Each vesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred \nto herein as a \u201c Vesting Date. \u201d)  Unless and until the Company elects to issue fractional Shares in \nsettlement of a vested RSU, any fractional RSUs that vest on a Vesting Date shall be carried forward and \nvest when such combined fractional RSUs result in a full RSU and any fractional RSU that is not carried \nforward as a result of a termination of the Award prior to the next subsequent Vesting Date shall be \nforfeited.\n4.

Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 \nbelow, vesting of the Award requires continued active employment or service through each applicable \nVesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and the rights and \nbenefits under this Award Agreement.  Employment or service for only a portion of the period between the \nAward Date and the first Vesting Date, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any \nproportionate vesting of the Award.  For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include \n(a) the duration of an approved leave of absence (other than a personal leave of absence) and (b) the \nfirst thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence, in each case as approved by the \nCompany, in its sole discretion.

Introduction\nThis Rule 10 D-1 Recovery Policy (the \u201cPolicy\u201d) is administered by the People and \nCompensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. (the \u201cCommittee\u201d), and \ncovers Incentive-Based Compensation granted, awarded or paid by Apple Inc. or any of \nits subsidiaries (\u201cApple\u201d) to any employee who is an \u201cexecutive officer\u201d of Apple (each a \n\u201cCovered Executive\u201d) as defined under Section 10D-1 of the Securities and Exchange \nAct\u00a0 of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d). The Policy is intended to comply with, and as applicable \nto be administered and interpreted consistent with, and subject to the exceptions set \nforth in, Listing Rule 5608 adopted by the Nasdaq Stock Market to implement Rule \n10D-1 under the Exchange Act (collectively referred to herein as \u201cRule 10D-1\u201d). For \navoidance of doubt the Policy only applies to Covered Executives who served as a \nCovered Executive for Apple at any point during the performance period for any \nIncentive-Based Compensation that is Received on or after October 2, 2023. The Policy \nexplains when Apple will be required to seek recovery of erroneously awarded \nIncentive-Based Compensation from a Covered Executive.  \nB. Incentive-Based Compensation\nFor purposes of this Policy, \u201cIncentive-Based Compensation\u201d means any compensation \ngranted, earned or vested based in whole or in part upon the attainment of one or more \nfinancial reporting measures, that was Received (i) on or after October 2, 2023 and (ii) \nby a person who served as a Covered Executive at any time during the performance \nperiod for the Incentive-Based Compensation. Financial reporting measures are (i) any \nmeasure(s) that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting \nprinciples used in Apple\u2019s financial statements and any measure(s) derived in whole or \nin part from such measure(s) and (ii) any measure(s) that are based in whole or in part \non Apple\u2019s stock price or total shareholder return. For avoidance of doubt, Incentive-\nBased Compensation includes awards granted to a Covered Executive that are \noutstanding and unvested as of October 2, 2023. Incentive-Based Compensation is \n\u201cReceived\u201d in the fiscal period that the relevant financial reporting measure is attained \nregardless of when it is paid or awarded.\nFor avoidance of doubt, incentive-based compensation that is not earned or vested \nbased on the attainment of one or more financial measures, including but not limited to \ntime-based restricted stock units, is not covered compensation under this Policy but \nmay be recouped under the Apple Inc. Executive Team Compensation Recoupment \nPolicy. \nExhibit 97.1", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2654, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b542b42-7e97-4c0f-b4c6-975db494390d": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b542b42-7e97-4c0f-b4c6-975db494390d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "120", "file_name": "Apple_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Apple_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 963934, "creation_date": "2025-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aea486d4-b3a8-4d04-9654-df0efbd60a22", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "120", "file_name": "Apple_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Apple_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 963934, "creation_date": "2025-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-10"}, "hash": "f2a9677a916c58af863f0eeaa3b9e336048bdf03d64cd4bd7153e3bc04c04959", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "C. Administration\nThe Committee is authorized and directed to consult with the full Board or such other \ncommittees of the Board as may be necessary or appropriate for the administration of \nthis Policy and engage third parties as it deems necessary to evaluate erroneously \nawarded Incentive-Based Compensation Received. If the Committee determines \nIncentive-Based Compensation was erroneously awarded and recovery is required \npursuant to this Policy, Apple shall make any required disclosures for any affected \nCovered Executives in its annual proxy statement. Apple will maintain and will provide to \nthe Nasdaq Stock Market documentation of all determinations and actions taken in \ncomplying with the Policy.  Any determinations made by the Committee under this \nPolicy shall be final and binding on all affected individuals.  \nD. Section 10D-1 Recovery \nPursuant to Rule 10D-1, the Committee will make reasonable efforts to recover any \nIncentive-Based Compensation Received by any Covered Executive during the three \ncompleted fiscal years immediately preceding the date that Apple is required to prepare \nan Accounting Restatement under Rule 10D-1 and any transition period of less than \nnine months that is within or immediately following such three years if the Committee \ndetermines the Incentive-Based Compensation was erroneously awarded. An \n\u201cAccounting Restatement\u201d is a correction to Apple\u2019s financial statements that, due to \nApple\u2019s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under U.S. \nfederal securities laws, is (1) is material to a prior financial reporting period or (2) would \nbe material to the current financial reporting period if corrected in the current period or \nleft uncorrected in the current period.  \nRecovery will be limited to the amount of the gross, pre-tax, Incentive-Based \nCompensation that was erroneously Received because it exceeded the amount that \nwould have been Received had it been determined based on any restated financial \nmeasures in the Accounting Restatement. If the Incentive-Based Compensation is \nbased on stock price or total shareholder return, the Committee shall determine a \nreasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement, if any, on the stock \nprice or total shareholder return and based on that reasonable estimate, whether \nIncentive-Based Compensation was erroneously awarded. \nIf the erroneo usly awarded Incentive-Based Compensation cannot be recovered \nbecause recovery efforts are excessively burdensome, the recovery value exceeds the \ncost of recovery to Apple or recovery would be contrary to laws outside the United \nStates, each as determined in accordance with Rule 10D-1, the Committee will make a \ndetermination whether further recovery efforts would be in shareholders\u2019 best interests \nand should continue or would otherwise be excusable under Rule 10D-1.\n2", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2878, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77ff2be4-c43a-4c32-b1bb-9cc342cd46be": {"__data__": {"id_": "77ff2be4-c43a-4c32-b1bb-9cc342cd46be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "121", "file_name": "Apple_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Apple_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 963934, "creation_date": "2025-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1a2b4b1d-a56b-4694-bae0-203afc9727ab", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "121", "file_name": "Apple_10k.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\Apple_10k.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 963934, "creation_date": "2025-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-10"}, "hash": "03fb26589f5b0013d3655856085ffbbc9c74542ac1485174dc3a8ca9313c460e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "If the Comm ittee de termines a Covered Executive Received erroneously awarded \nIncentive-Based Compensation, the Committee shall determine the timing and method \nof recovery in its sole direction and direct Apple to recover any erroneously awarded \namounts as soon as administratively practicable.
